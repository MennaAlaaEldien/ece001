 <h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
 <hr><hr>
  <p>
    <b>Artificial intelligence (AI)</b>
       refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines
      that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.
      The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits
       associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.
    </p>
    <h1>History of AI</h1>
    <p>The idea of inanimate objects coming to life as intelligent beings has been around for a long time.
       The ancient Greeks had myths about robots,
        and Chinese and Egyptian engineers built automatons.</p>

   <p>The beginnings of modern AI can be traced to classical philosophers'
      attempts to describe human thinking as a symbolic system.
      But the field of AI wasn't formally founded until 1956,
      at a conference at Dartmouth College, in Hanover,
      New Hampshire, where the term "artificial intelligence" was coined.<br>
